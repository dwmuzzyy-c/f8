Some `float` features that should keep in mind
1. Floated Elements become `block-level` element: 
- Even with display: inline, when an element is assigned `float`
- Example: `<a>` tag is an inline display element. In terms of layout, when `float` is assigned to `<a>` tag, it becomes a block-level element [`display: block`], the other elements will wrap around it and it will be get out of `normal flow`
2. `Width` Behavior: 
- Floated Elements do not take up full width of its parent/ container width. Instead, it only takes up as much as its content needs.

Some properties that work with `float`

1. `clear`
- This property is used to control the floating elements' behavior. 
- It specifies whether an element should be moved below the floating elements that precedes it.

2. `display`
This will ensure that the element with the class clearfix will not be affected by any floating elements before it.
display: The display property can affect how elements interact with floats. For instance, display: inline-block; can be used to create block-level elements that flow inline with text and other inline elements, which can be useful in conjunction with floats.
position: The position property can be used to control the placement of elements in relation to floats. For example, position: absolute; can be used to position an element independently of the normal flow, which can help manage complex layouts involving floats.
margin: Margins can be used to create space around floated elements. For example:
CSS

.float-left {
  float: left;
  margin-right: 10px;
}

overflow: The overflow property can be used to manage how content is displayed when it overflows the bounds of its container. Setting overflow: auto; or overflow: hidden; on a container can help clear floats within it:
CSS

.container {
  overflow: auto;
}
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
width and height: These properties can be used to define the dimensions of floated elements, which can help control the layout and ensure that elements are sized appropriately within their containers.
